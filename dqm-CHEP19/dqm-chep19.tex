\abstract{
The DUNE Collaboration has successfully implemented and currently operates
an experimental program based at CERN which includes a beam test and an extended
cosmic ray run of two large-scale prototypes of the DUNE Far Detector.
The volume of data already collected by the protoDUNE-SP (the single-phase
Liquid Argon TPC prototype) amounts to approximately 3PB and the sustained rate
of data sent to mass storage is of the order of O(100) MB/s. In addition to this
data being committed to mass storage and processed in the Grid environment, a small
fraction of it is captured by the protoDUNE Prompt Processing System (p3s).
The p3s is optimized for continuous low-latency calculation of the vital detector
metrics and parameters as well as the output rendered as event display images.
This system is the platform for Data Quality Monitoring in protoDUNE-SP and
has served a crucial role starting from the commissioning of the apparatus and
throughout its operation in 2018-2019, which continues at the time of writing.
We present our experience in operating the system in the CERN environment, along
with work currently underway to make the system more scalable, resilient and
to simplify system recovery procedures in preparation for the second beam
run of protoDUNE-SP foreseen after the Long Shutdown 2 of the LHC.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
Your text comes here. Separate text sections with
\section{Section title}
\label{sec-1}
For bibliography use \cite{RefJ}
\subsection{Subsection title}
\label{sec-2}
Don't forget to give each section, subsection, subsubsection, and
paragraph a unique label (see Sect.~\ref{sec-1}).

For one-column wide figures use syntax of figure~\ref{fig-1}
\begin{figure}[h]
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1cm,clip]{figures/dqm_purmon_20190910_1.png}
\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\label{fig-1}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

For two-column wide figures use syntax of figure~\ref{fig-2}
\begin{figure*}
\centering
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file. See example above.
% If not, use
\vspace*{5cm}       % Give the correct figure height in cm
\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\label{fig-2}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure*}

For figure with sidecaption legend use syntax of figure
\begin{figure}
% Use the relevant command for your figure-insertion program
% to insert the figure file.
\centering
\sidecaption
\includegraphics[width=5cm,clip]{figures/dqm_purmon_20190910_1.png}
\caption{Please write your figure caption here}
\label{fig-3}       % Give a unique label
\end{figure}

For tables use syntax in table~\ref{tab-1}.
\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Please write your table caption here}
\label{tab-1}       % Give a unique label
% For LaTeX tables you can use
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
first & second & third  \\\hline
number & number & number \\
number & number & number \\\hline
\end{tabular}
% Or use
\vspace*{5cm}  % with the correct table height
\end{table}
%
% BibTeX or Biber users please use (the style is already called in the class, ensure that the "woc.bst" style is in your local directory)
% \bibliography{name or your bibliography database}
%
% Non-BibTeX users please use
%
\begin{thebibliography}{}
%
% and use \bibitem to create references.
%
\bibitem{RefJ}
% Format for Journal Reference
Journal Author, Journal \textbf{Volume}, page numbers (year)
% Format for books
\bibitem{RefB}
Book Author, \textit{Book title} (Publisher, place, year) page numbers
% etc
\end{thebibliography}
