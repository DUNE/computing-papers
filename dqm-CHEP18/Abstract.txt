Title: The ProtoDUNE Prompt Processing System

The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) will employ a uniquely large Liquid Argon
Time Projection chamber as the main component of its Far Detector. It will include four
10kt modules which will include single and dual-phase Liquid Argon technologies.
In order to validate its design an ambitious experimental program (named "protoDUNE") has
been initiated which includes a beam test of large-scale DUNE prototypes at CERN in 2018.
This presentation concerns itself with the single-phase detector. The volume of data to
be collected in this test will amount to a few petabytes and the sustained rate of data
sent to mass storage will be in the range of a few hundred MB per second. In addition
to careful design of the Data Acquisition, Online Monitoring and Data Handling systems,
the protoDUNE experiment requires substantial Data Quality Monitoring capabilities in
order to ascertain the condition of the detector and its various subsystems. To this end,
a Prompt Processing system has been designed which is complementary to Online Monitoring
and is characterized by lower bandwidth, substantial CPU resources and end-to-end latency
on the scale of a few minutes. We present the design of the ProtoDUNE Prompt Processing
system, the current status of its development and testing and issues related to its interfaces
and deployment.
