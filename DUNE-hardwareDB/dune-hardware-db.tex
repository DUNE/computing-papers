\begin{abstract}
\noindent  Due to its complexity DUNE requires systems and tools for control, accounting and
management in the area of manufacturing, QC, logistics, installation and maintenance. These systems
will involve databases which include hardware/QC/construction/installation DBs,
``Parts Breakdown Structure`` and others. The challenge is to ensure proper
interconnectivity and interoperability of these databases with others such as calibration,
slow controls etc which is necessary for commissioning and continued
operations. We consider minimal reasonable requirements to the design of the databases
and their interfaces. Technology downselect is outside of the scope of this document.

\section{Overview}

The most recent experience in DUNE with systems of this kind comes from the protoDUNE-SP experiment.
The experiment employed hardware/QC databases which were distinct in both
design and implementation for each major element of construction and installation. For example, the CE QC
systems were designed specifically for purposes of testing and quality control of the Cold Electronics,
and were distinct from databases used in manufacturing of the FEMB, APAs/CPAs, cabling database etc.

The DUNE experiment represents a completely different scale in terms of the component count and
overall complexity

\section{Assumptions}

Consider the following assumptions:

\begin{itemize}

\item Every hardware component used in DUNE needs to be described in the
system and accompanied by information with content and level of detail necessary to ensure
successful manufacture, QC, delivery, assembly, installation, commissioning and operation and maintenance of
DUNE

\item Likewise, associations of the components need to be described in the system
in ways specific to each situation; ``association'' may mean either aggregation of components
in a hierarchical manner e.g.\,electronic installed on a FEMB, or in terms of point-to-point connections

\end{itemize}
