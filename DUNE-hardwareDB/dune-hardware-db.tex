\begin{abstract}
\noindent  Due to its complexity DUNE requires systems to aid in control, accounting and management
in the area of manufacuring, QC, logistics and installation. These systems involve databases which
are include hardware/QC/construction/installation DBs , Parts Breakdown Structure and others.
The challenge is to ensure proper interconnectivity and interoperability of these databases with
others such as calibration, slow controls etc which is necessary for commissioning and continued
operations.
